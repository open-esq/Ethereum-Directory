# Chapter 1: Wallets and Utilities

## 1.1 Introduction

## 1.2 Wallets

### MetaMask

MetaMask is a popular wallet because it allows users to interact with Ethereum's decentralized applications (called "DApps").  It runs a light client within the user's web browser.  It's currently compatible with Chrome, Brave, and Mozilla.

***How to get it.*** The following instructions are from Anton Anonopoulos and Dr. Gavin Wood's seminal book, Mastering Ethereum:

>Open the Google Chrome browser and navigate to https://chrom.google.com/webstore/category/extentions.  Search for “MetaMask” and click on the logo of a fox.  [Make sure the extension is offered by https://metamask.io, that it has over 1,400 reviews, and has more than 1,000,000 users.  This is important to ensure that it’s not a malicious counterfeit.]  Once you confirm you are looking at the correct extension, click “Add to Chrome” to install it.

Once MetaMask is installed you should see a new icon (the head of a fox) in your browser’s toolbar.  Click on it to get started.  You will be asked to accept the terms and conditions and then to create your new Ethereum wallet by entering a password […].

Once you’re set a password, MetaMask will generate a wallet for you and show you a mnemonic backup consisting of 12 English words […].  These words can be used in any compatible wallet to recover access to your funds should something happen to MetaMask on your computer.  You do not need the password for this recovery; the 12 words are sufficient.

You account page shows the name of your account […], an Ethereum address […], and a colorful icon to help you visually distinguish this account from other accounts.  At the top of the account page, you can see which Ethereum network you are currently working on […].


### Ethereum Foundation's Wallet

The Ethereum Foundation developed its own wallet application, simply called "Ethereum Wallet."  This wallet offers three sync modes, fast, light, and full.

***How to get it.***
The latest version of Ethereum Wallet can be downloaded from https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases.  Note that the Ethereum Foundation also produced a web3 browser called "Mist", but it has been discontinued.

### My Ether Wallet

My Ether Wallet ("MEW") allows users to generate wallets within their personal web browsers, allowing them to hold their assets and wallet information offline.  This feature safeguards wallets by precenting disclosures to online exchanges.  It also makes the user solely responsible for securiting access information.  Simply put, if you lose your wallet information, you have no one to blame but yourself.

### Parity

Parity markets itself as "the fasted and most advanced Ethereum client."  Parity, like the Ethereum Foundation's wallet, syncs directly with the Ethereum blockchain; but it's accessible through your web browser.  It also offers an offline wallet for mobile devices called "Parity Signer," and a light wallet called "Parity Feather."  It is written in a newer programming language called "Rust."
